# Etch-a-Sketch

Etch-a-Sketch is a web development project with the focus on DOM manipulation. The idea is to make a grid of squares in a website so that each square changes its color when hovered, simulating an etch-a-sketch.

The Project is part of the Javascript section of the Foundations course of The Odin Project's curriculum.

## Running it

To run Etch-a-Sketch (still a work-in-progress) just download the repository and run ```index.html``` in a browser. Once the project is finished I'll host it in GitHub so the repository doesn't need to be downloaded to run it.
